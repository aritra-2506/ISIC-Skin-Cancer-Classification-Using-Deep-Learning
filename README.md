# ISIC-Skin-Cancer-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning
Uses ISIC Dataset - RGB images and imbalanced dataset and loading data from directory

basicModel uses a newly created model and achieves an accuracy of near about 70%.
preTrainedModel used a pre-trained Xception model along with a few extra layers added in the end and achieves and accuracy of near about 74%.

Dataset is imbalanced and only nearly a smaller dataset of 6007 images have been used instead of the original dataset with 25331 images due to lesser computation power of CPU.
